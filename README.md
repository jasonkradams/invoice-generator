## Key Features Explained

### Percentage-Based Pricing
Instead of traditional quantity Ã— rate calculation, this system uses:
**Amount = Rate Ã— (Percentage Ã· 100)**

This allows for flexible pricing scenarios like:
- Partial services (50% of full rate)
- Discounted rates (80% of standard rate)
- Premium services (120% of base rate)

### Keyboard Navigation
- Tab through all invoice fields seamlessly
- When tabbing out of the last "Amount" field, automatically creates a new item
- Cursor jumps to the Description field of the new item
- Enables rapid invoice entry without mouse interaction

### Template System
- Any invoice can be marked as a template
- Templates appear in the "Load from Previous Invoice" dropdown
- All field values are preserved, including custom percentages
- Perfect for recurring billing scenarios
